# Learn Go: A Step-by-Step Tutorial Series

Welcome! This repository contains a complete tutorial series for learning the Go programming language from the ground up. Each lesson is designed to be self-contained, with clear explanations and runnable code.

This series is perfect for:
*   Beginners who have never programmed in Go.
*   Developers coming from other languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  Each lesson is in its own numbered folder (e.g., `tutorial_1/`).
2.  Inside each folder, you will find:
    *   `main.go`: The complete, commented Go code for that lesson.
    *   `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the concepts, the code, and how to run it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Go installed** on your machine. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).
- A code editor of your choice (VS Code with the Go extension is a great option).
- Basic familiarity with using a command line or terminal.
